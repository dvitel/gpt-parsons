Title: {{title}}

Topics: {{topic}}

Task: {{task}}

Pseudocode:
{{pseudocode}}

Based on the provided pseudocode, title, and list of topics, generate a Parsons puzzle that integrates these themes into its structure. The puzzle should not only rearrange code snippets into the correct order but also reflect the overarching themes and concepts indicated in the title and topic list. This will help reinforce the learning objectives for high school students.

Python Program:
[Generate the corresponding Python program that aligns with the pseudocode, title, and topics. Break down the program into discrete, logical blocks that can be used as the basis for the Parsons puzzle. Each block should clearly represent a step or concept in the code, while also being themed around the title and topics provided. The program should be a direct reflection of the pseudocode, ensuring consistency and thematic relevance. Make sure each line has a step comment associated with it for easy reorganization as a parson's puzzle]

Comment the code heavily so that it is easily understood. Generate the code block, comments, and nothing else.

output:
