# Title: Loopin' Lists
# Topics: loops, lists

# Step 1: Declare and initialize a list variable called "numbers"
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Step 2: Declare a loop variable called "index" and set it to 0
index = 0

# Step 3: Start a loop that runs while the value of "index" is less than the length of the list "numbers"
while index < len(numbers):
    # Step 5: Declare a variable called "currentNumber" and set it to the value at the index position of "numbers"
    currentNumber = numbers[index]
    
    # Step 6: Print the value of "currentNumber"
    print(currentNumber)
    
    # Step 7: Increment the value of "index" by 1
    index += 1

# Step 9: Declare a loop variable called "item" and set it to the value at the first index of "numbers"
item = numbers[0]

# Step 10: Start a loop that runs while "item" is not equal to 5
while item != 5:
    # Step 11: Print "Looping!"
    print("Looping!")
    
    # Step 12: Add 2 to the value of "item"
    item += 2
```

```python
# Step 1: Define an array called "numbers" to store a list of integers.
numbers = []

# Step 2: Initialize an empty array called "evenNumbers" to store even integers.
evenNumbers = []

# Step 3: Initialize an empty array called "oddNumbers" to store odd integers.
oddNumbers = []

# Step 4: Use a loop to iterate through each number in the "numbers" array.
for number in numbers:
    
    # Step 5: Within the loop, check if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator.
    if number % 2 == 0:
        # Step 6: If the number is divisible by 2 (even), add it to the "evenNumbers" array.
        evenNumbers.append(number)
    else:
        # Step 7: If the number is not divisible by 2 (odd), add it to the "oddNumbers" array.
        oddNumbers.append(number)

# Step 8: After the loop ends, print the "evenNumbers" array.
print(evenNumbers)

# Step 9: After the loop ends, print the "oddNumbers" array.
print(oddNumbers)

This code represents the pseudocode provided and aligns with the title and topics. Each step mentioned in the pseudocode is clearly indicated in the code block with a corresponding comment. The code has been organized to reflect the logical flow of the task, making it suitable for a Parsons puzzle.
```python
# 1. Initialization:
numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25] # DECLARE Array numbers[]
sum = 0 # DECLARE INTEGER sum = 0
count = 0 # DECLARE INTEGER count = 0

# 2. Array Traversal Loop:
for number in numbers: # FOR EACH number IN numbers

    # 3. Sum Calculation:
    sum += number # ADD number TO sum
    count += 1 # INCREMENT count

    # 4. End Loop
    # Implied by the ending of the Python for loop

# 5. Average Calculation:
avg = sum / count # SET avg = sum DIVIDE BY count

# 6. Print Statements:
print("The sum of the array is: ") # PRINT "The sum of the array is:"
print(sum) # PRINT sum
print("The average of the array is:") # PRINT "The average of the array is:"
print(avg) # PRINT avg
```
